You can change the waittimes after signing up, 10 seconds should insure no ban if you aren't using any proxies, less would probably work fine aswell.

CATCHALL FILE = USE WITH A CATCHALL DOMAIN - EDIT the DOMAIN TO YOUR DOMAIN.

GMAIL FILE - Enter your gmail prefix (if your gmail is github@gmail.com your prefix would be github) between the ''.

Install the dependencies with pip in the dependensies file (use google)

MAC TRY THESE:

sudo pip install requests

sudo pip install bs4

sudo pip install datetime

sudo pip install names

or

sudo pip3 install requests

sudo pip3 install bs4

sudo pip3 install datetime

sudo pip3 install names

Windows:

# HOW TO USE PROXIES
Make a new folder with a random name, place the gmailProxySupportNoProfiles.py or catchallProxySupportNoProfiles.py and a file called proxy.txt with 1 proxy in it and run it, if you want to run on multiple proxies just make multiple folders all with a different proxy in the proxy.txt this way they will all make one account per 10 seconds to avoid any ban.
